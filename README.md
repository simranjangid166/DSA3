# STUDENT DOCUMENT SIMILARITY ANALYSIS

## Description

String Matching Application is a Java-based text comparison application designed to identify matching and similar content between text documents.

The application reads multiple `.txt` files from a corpus folder, compares every pair of documents, calculates their similarity percentage, and displays the matching results in the terminal.

## Problem Statement

Comparing multiple documents manually to identify duplicated or similar content is time-consuming and difficult.

The proposed application automates the comparison process by analyzing text documents and calculating a similarity percentage between document pairs. This helps identify documents that contain matching or duplicated content.

## Application

The application is a text string-matching and document comparison system used to find matching or common content between documents.

## Objectives

- To compare multiple text documents automatically.
- To identify matching content between documents.
- To calculate the similarity percentage between document pairs.
- To classify documents based on their similarity level.
- To display the comparison results clearly in the terminal.

## Features

- Reads multiple `.txt` files from a corpus folder.
- Compares every unique pair of documents.
- Uses the Z-Algorithm for string matching.
- Calculates similarity percentage.
- Sorts matching results in descending order.
- Displays the similarity percentage in the terminal.
- Provides a similarity-based classification.

## Algorithm Used

### Z-Algorithm

The Z-Algorithm is a linear-time string matching algorithm used to find occurrences of a pattern within a text.

In this application, document content is divided into text chunks. The Z-Algorithm is used to check whether chunks from one document occur in another document.

## Similarity Calculation

The similarity percentage is calculated using the number of matched chunks between two documents.

```text
Similarity Percentage =
(Matched Chunks / Total Chunks) × 100
```

The application considers the chunks from both documents while calculating the similarity percentage.

## Similarity Classification

The results can be interpreted as:

| Similarity Percentage | Classification |
|----------------------|----------------|
| 80% and above | Completely Duplicated |
| 50% – 79.99% | Moderately Similar |
| Below 50% | Not Duplicated |

- Algorithms Implemented: Z-Algorithm, Bitmask DP, Network Flow (Edmonds-Karp), Naive String Matching

## About the Project

The Student Document Similarity Checker is a web-based application designed to analyze and compare text documents for similarity. It evaluates pairs of text documents from a corpus and runs multiple string-matching and graph algorithms—such as the Z-Algorithm, Bitmask DP, Network Flow (Edmonds-Karp), and Naive String Matching—to calculate a final similarity score. The application provides a visual interface to see matched chunks, algorithmic execution times, and comparative performance.

## How the Application Works

1. The application looks for the `corpus` folder.
2. It reads all `.txt` files present in the folder.
3. The contents of the documents are preprocessed and divided into chunks.
4. Each unique pair of documents is compared.
5. The Z-Algorithm checks for matching chunks.
6. The similarity percentage is calculated.
7. The results are sorted from highest to lowest similarity.
8. The matching results are displayed in the terminal.

## How to Run

Open the terminal in the `ProjectCode` folder.

Compile the Java program:

```bash
javac DocMatching.java
```

Run the program:

```bash
java DocMatching
```

Make sure the `corpus` folder is present inside the `ProjectCode` folder.

## Sample Output

The following image shows the sample output of the String Matching Application executed in the terminal.

## Applications

- Plagiarism detection
- Duplicate document detection
- Assignment comparison
- Report comparison
- Text content matching
- Document similarity analysis

## Expected Outcome

The application provides an automated way to compare text documents and identify matching content.

It calculates a similarity percentage for document pairs and displays the results in descending order, helping users quickly identify highly similar or duplicated documents.

## Conclusion

The String Matching Application demonstrates the practical use of string matching techniques for document comparison.

By using the Z-Algorithm, the application can efficiently search for matching text chunks and calculate similarity between documents. The project provides a simple terminal-based solution for identifying duplicated and similar textual content.
